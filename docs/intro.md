# About these notes

This repository is a reflection of my commitment to continuous learning and personal growth. It serves as a structured way to document my journey, allowing me to revisit key milestones, track my progress, and consolidate my knowledge over time.

All the notes and guides are carefully organized to facilitate understanding and provide a step-by-step approach to various topics. 

## How It Works

The documentation is built using **Docusaurus**, a  React-based static site generator optimized for technical content and documentation, and is deployed on **GitHub Pages**.
